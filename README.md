You can choose two kinds of 
 -> mention pull requests for self implemented parsers for other taxonomies 

 // mention that we use IC based/redefined algorithms bc they are more accurate
 // mention that our tool is for DISTANCE not similarity calculations 
 // mention that this is for single ontologies only
